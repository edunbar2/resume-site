            <p>  Hi there! I am a Senior in computer science and McRae scholar at the University of North Carolina Asheville.
                I am currently alternating semesters between finishing my major requirements as well as my minor in Anthropology,
                and working full time at the Georgia Tech Research Institute as an IT Co-op. After graduation, I hope to continue my work in IT, focusing in networking and network security.
                <br>In highschool, I was head of the programming team on my robotics team, where we managed to get our robot to state finals every year. Once I got to college, I began to focusing
                less on the development side of things and chose instead to hone my skills in IT support. I began working with my parents company to grow my knowledge in information technology.
                Now I am working at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), honing my skills even further and ensuring I can bring the best customer support possible to whoever is in need of assistance.
            </p>
